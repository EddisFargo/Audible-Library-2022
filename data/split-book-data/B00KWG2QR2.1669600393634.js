But this love has conditions: They agree it will last only one hour, and it will be only make-believe.&nbsp;</p> <p>When their hour is up and the girl rushes off like Cinderella, Daniel tries to convince himself that what happened between them seemed perfect only because they were pretending it was. Moments like that happen only in fairy tales.&nbsp;</p> <p>One year and one bad relationship later, his disbelief in love-at-first-sight is stripped away the day he meets Six: a girl with a strange name and an even stranger personality. Unfortunately for Daniel, finding true love doesn’t guarantee a happily ever after—it only further threatens it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Will an unbearable secret from the past jeopardize Daniel and Six’s only chance at saving each other?</p>";
