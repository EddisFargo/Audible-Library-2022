window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Please Note: This content is not for kids. This audio comedy features adult language (hurled especially at one malicious, phony Kelly Smith). Discretion is advised.</b></p> <p>In this dramatic comedy, <i>Parks and Recreation</i> and <i>Good Girls</i> star Retta brings humor and strength to her role as the unforgettable Tinaca Jones.</p> <p>What’s in a name? A lot. The name Tinaca, for example, has been passed down in the Jones family for generations of women. In fact, the Joneses name a Tinaca every other generation, to let the name breathe a little. To let each Tinaca shine. And shine is exactly what Tinaca Jones intends to do.</p> <p>A grocery cashier by day and household name in the making by night, Tinaca Jones pays her dues, saves her coins, and takes business and marketing classes. She spends every second readying to launch her lifestyle brand for anyone who wants to live like her - that is, intentionally and fabulously. But when a basic blonde with an even more basic name, Kelly Smith, approaches her register and peeps her nametag, Tinaca’s plans come crashing down all around her.</p> <p>The next thing Tinaca knows, Kelly Smith has launched herself into overnight fame with a pathetic, old-as-time, red-carpet stunt, using the stage name \"Tinaca Jones\". But Kelly Smith messed with the wrong woman. What follows is Tinaca Jones’s wild and triumphant account of the battle to reclaim her name, told over the course of an epic and hilarious deposition.&nbsp;</p>";
