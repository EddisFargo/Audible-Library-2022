window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Back by popular demand! The further, fearsome, and funny adventures of Andrea Vernon and the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection - written by Alexander C. Kane and performed by Bahni Turpin, 2018 Audie Award winner for Best Female Narrator. </b></p> <p>More than a year after she helped save the world from the Sparnaxian invasion, Andrea Vernon is in a good place. Her boss is giving her greater responsibility and she’s getting to travel a lot (although her fill-in is hopeless at making coffee); things could be getting even more serious with her 8’ 4” superhero boyfriend, The Big Axe; and she has a really fun new BFF, Never More.&nbsp;</p> <p>Small issue, though, with that last item - Never More is a supervillain bent on world domination, and it looks as if nothing can stop her. Especially since Congress is determined to bring the Corporation for UltraHuman Protection and all of “Big Supe” under government control.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even with mankind’s greatest heroes fighting back, will it fall on Andrea to save the day - again?</p>";
