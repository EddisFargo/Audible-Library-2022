window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Hamish Macbeth, constable in the small Scottish Highland town of Lochdubh, is feeling down after losing both his promotion and his girlfriend, the town beauty, Priscilla Halbourton-Smythe. A trip to a charming seaside inn with his dog, Towser, is meant to raise his sagging spirits.&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead, he arrives at “Friendly House” to find the ambiance chilling, the food inedible, and his fellow guests less than neighborly. There’s an amorous spinster, two flirty girls, a retired military man, a secretive London family, and Bob Harris, who so nags his wife, Doris, that everyone wants to kill him. Then somebody does.&nbsp;</p> <p>Soon Macbeth is called upon to act - to dig into the past and deep into the heart to deliver something more daunting than merely the culprit: Justice.</p>";
