But when she’s thrown out of a young ladies’ academy, Olivia doubts she’ll ever find someone who will love her, rather than her bank account. To make matters worse, her dissolute cousin Felix is determined to marry her against her wishes. A virtual prisoner in her guardians’ London townhouse, Olivia can’t help but develop a&nbsp;<i>tendre&nbsp;</i>for her neighbor, a handsome Scottish&nbsp;marquess.&nbsp;</p> <p>Battle-scarred in more ways than one, Hamish MacQueen, Lord Sleat, has braved many dangers in life.

Just in the nick of time his pretty neighbor appears, offering to act as a nursemaid for the young girl on their journey to his estate in Scotland. He suspects she has her own reasons for wanting to flee the country....</p> <p>The close traveling quarters leads to a fierce attraction between Olivia and Hamish that seems impossible to resist.
