window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Billy Winston’s family is going to see him happy and in love, if it’s the last thing they do. </b></p> <p>No one deserves a \"happily ever after\" quite as much as the second oldest Winston brother and his lady love Claire McClure (a.k.a. Scarlet St. Claire). Cruelty and circumstance tore them apart almost 20 years ago. Secrecy and bitterness kept them separated.</p> <p>But do you know who's tired of their separation and stubbornness? Everyone. Especially Billy Winston’s family. And now, they're going to do something about it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Well-meaning interference means the star-crossed lovers can’t stop tripping over each other in the hills of Tuscany, the catacombs of Rome, and the waterways of Venice. Billy and Claire find themselves thrown together and at the mercy of the Winston siblings’ shenanigans.&nbsp;</p> <p>But will their forced proximity bring them together or push them even further apart?&nbsp;</p> <p>This second-chance romance brings back the entire Winston gang playing cupid in one last story of love, hijinks, and family collusion.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Beard Necessities</i> is a full-length contemporary romantic comedy, and can be listened to as a stand-alone, but it’s probably best to listen to it after the previous books in the Winston Brothers series.</p>";
