window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>True love is on the line in this charming, laugh-out-loud rom-com - created specifically for the audio format!</b></p> <p>Paint your toes. Pick up the wrong coffee and bagel order. Drive from Brooklyn to Jersey in traffic so slow you want to tear your hair out. It’s amazing all the useless things I can accomplish while on hold for three hours with customer service. Three hours when I should be getting the Date-in-a-Box website ready to launch at the big business expo in a few days. Except my shiny new website is glitching, and my inner rage-monster is ready to scorch some earth...when he finally picks up. Not the robot voice I expected but a real live human named Kal. He’s surprisingly <i>helpful</i> and really knows his stuff, even if he’s a little awkward...in an adorable way.&nbsp;</p> <p>And suddenly I’m flirting with him? And I think he’s flirting back. <br> And suddenly it’s been hours, and we’re still on the phone talking and ordering each other takeout while he troubleshoots my website. <br> And suddenly we’re exchanging numbers and sending texts and DMs every day, leaving voice mails (who even does that anymore?!). <br> And suddenly I’m wondering if it’s possible for two people to fall in love at first talk.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because I’m falling...<i>hard</i>.&nbsp;</p>";
