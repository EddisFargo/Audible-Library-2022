window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Before he was nicknamed “Sting” by the leader of a local show band in northeast England, Gordon Sumner knew he was meant for more than his working-class background promised. He just didn’t know how to get there. In <i>Upon Reflection</i>, hear the singular talent trace his unlikely rise from his days as a young husband and father working as a local schoolteacher, to risking everything on a fateful move to London, and joining an aspiring punk band called The Police.&nbsp;</p> <p>The worldwide success of The Police was only the beginning of Sting’s four decades of glory, disappointment, accomplishment, and unexpected good fortune. Featuring new recordings of “Roxanne”, “Message in a Bottle”, “Fields of Gold”, and other classics, <i>Upon Reflection</i> finds the iconic artist revealing his fascinating journey in intimate detail. Hear how a provincial boy determined to make his artistic mark, found his way, and changed our musical landscape.</p>";
