The trip is difficult, and before it is finished all her expectations are overturned. Alone, friendless, stripped of her crown and her title, Ani must learn to make her own path in the world. Along the way, she just might learn to be a princess.</p> <p>Bold in concept, stunning in execution, <i>The Goose Girl</i> is one of the most spectacular debut novels of recent years. Now more than four dozen actors bring it to thrilling new life in this unabridged audio editionâ€”a recording that will delight those who already love the book, and enthrall those who have not yet discovered it.</p>";
