window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There are three things you need to know about Fiona Archer...I would tell you what they are, but then I'd have to kill you. </p> <p>But I can tell you that Fiona's husband - the always irrepressible and often cantankerous Greg Archer - is desperately in love with his wife. He aches for her when they are apart, and is insatiable when they are together. Yet as the years pass, Greg has begun to suspect that Fiona is a ninja. A ninja mom. A ninja wife. A ninja friend. After 14 years of marriage, Greg is trying not to panic. Because Fiona's talent for blending in is starting to resemble fading away. </p> <p>However, when unexpected events mean Fiona must take center stage to keep her family safe, her response stuns everyone - Greg most of all. It seems like Greg's wish has come true. </p> <p>Except...not. </p> <p>When all is said and done, can Greg handle this new version of his wife? Will his irrepressible cantankerousness push her away? Or can the couple find a way forward without either being forced to step back into the shadows? </p>";
