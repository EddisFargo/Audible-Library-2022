window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Pulitzer Prize, Fiction, 2016</b> </p> <p>A profound, startling, and beautifully crafted debut novel, <i>The Sympathizer</i> is the story of a man of two minds, someone whose political beliefs clash with his individual loyalties. </p> <p>It is April 1975, and Saigon is in chaos. At his villa, a general of the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights out of the country. The general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles, unaware that one among their number, the captain, is secretly observing and reporting on the group to a higher-up in the Viet Cong. </p> <p><i>The Sympathizer</i> is the story of this captain: a man brought up by an absent French father and a poor Vietnamese mother, a man who went to university in America, but returned to Vietnam to fight for the Communist cause. A gripping spy novel, an astute exploration of extreme politics, and a moving love story, <i>The Sympathizer</i> explores a life between two worlds and examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the wars we fight today. </p>";
