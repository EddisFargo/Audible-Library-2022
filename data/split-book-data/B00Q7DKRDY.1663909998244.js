window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is a full-length novel, the fourth book in the Knitting in the City series. </p> <p>There are three things you need to know about Ashley Winston: 1) She has six brothers and they all have beards, 2) She is a reader, and 3) She knows how to knit. </p> <p>Former beauty queen Ashley Winston’s preferred coping strategy is escapism. She escaped her Tennessee small town, loathsome father, and six brothers eight years ago. Now she escapes life daily via her Amazon kindle one-click addiction. </p> <p>However, when a family tragedy forces her to return home, Ashley can’t escape the notice of Drew Runous - local Game Warden, bear wrestler, philosopher, and everyone’s favorite guy. Drew’s irksome philosophizing in particular makes Ashley want to run for the skyscrapers, especially since he can’t seem to keep his exasperating opinions - or his soulful poetry, steadfast support, and delightful hands - to himself. Pretty soon the girl who wanted nothing more than the escape of the big city finds she’s lost her heart in small town Tennessee.</p>";
