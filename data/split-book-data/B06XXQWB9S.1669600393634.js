window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Geek girl Elle Wittimer lives and breathes <i>Starfield</i>, the classic science-fiction series she grew up watching with her late father. So when she sees a cosplay contest for a new <i>Starfield</i> movie, she has to enter. The prize? An invitation to the ExcelsiCon Cosplay Ball and a meet-and-greet with the actor slated to play Federation Prince Carmindor in the reboot. With savings from her gig at the Magic Pumpkin food truck and her dad's old costume, Elle's determined to win - unless her stepsisters get there first. </p> <p>Teen actor Darien Freeman used to live for cons - before he was famous. Now they're nothing but autographs and awkward meet-and-greets. Playing Carmindor is all he has ever wanted, but <i>Starfield </i>fandom has written him off as just another dumb heartthrob. As ExcelsiCon draws near, Darien feels more and more like a fake - until he meets a girl who shows him otherwise. But when she disappears at midnight, will he ever be able to find her again? </p> <p>Part-romance, part-love letter to nerd culture, and all totally adorbs, <i>Geekerella</i> is a fairy tale for anyone who believes in the magic of fandom. </p>";
