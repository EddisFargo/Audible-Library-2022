window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A startling, fiercely feminist re-imagining of </b><b><i>Cinderella</i></b><b> from the best-selling, award-winning author Jennifer Donnelly.&nbsp;</b></p> <p><b>Don't just fracture the fairy tale. Shatter it.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Isabelle should be blissfully happy - she's about to win the handsome prince. Except Isabelle isn't the beautiful girl who lost the glass slipper and captured the prince's heart. She's the ugly stepsister who cut off her toes to fit into Cinderella's shoe...which is now filling with blood.&nbsp;</p> <p>Isabelle tried to fit in. She cut away pieces of herself in order to become pretty. Sweet. More like Cinderella. But that only made her mean, jealous, and hollow. Now she has a chance to alter her destiny and prove what ugly stepsisters have always known: it takes more than heartache to break a girl.&nbsp;</p> <p>Evoking the darker, original version of the <i>Cinderella </i>story, <i>Stepsister </i>shows us that ugly is in the eye of the beholder, and uses Jennifer Donnelly's trademark wit and wisdom to send an overlooked character on a journey toward empowerment, redemption...and a new definition of beauty.</p>";
