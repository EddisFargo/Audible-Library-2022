Amid a forest where the shades of the dead linger all around, every homesteader knows to follow the Simple Rules: \"Don't kindle flame, don't shed the blood of another, don't run at night. These things draw shades.\" Silence Montane has broken all three rules on more than one occasion. And to protect her family from a murderous gang with high bounties on their heads, Silence will break every rule again, at the risk of becoming a shade herself. </p>";
