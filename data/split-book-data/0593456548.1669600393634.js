window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A pretend relationship gives two friends more than they bargained for in a Renaissance Faire rom com filled with flower crowns, kilts, corsets, and sword fights.</b><br> <br> Single mother April Parker has lived in Willow Creek for 12 years with a wall around her heart. On the verge of being an empty nester, she’s decided to move on from her quaint little town, and asks her friend Mitch for his help with some home improvement projects to get her house ready to sell.&nbsp;</p> <p>Mitch Malone is known for being the life of every party, but mostly for the attire he wears to the local Renaissance Faire - a kilt (and not much else) that shows off his muscled form to perfection. While he agrees to help April, he needs a favor, too: She'll pretend to be his girlfriend at an upcoming family dinner, so that he can avoid the lectures about settling down and having a more “serious” career than high school coach and gym teacher. April reluctantly agrees, but when dinner turns into a weekend trip, it becomes hard to tell what's real and what's been just for show. But when the weekend ends, so must their fake relationship.&nbsp;</p> <p>As summer begins, Faire returns to Willow Creek, and April volunteers for the first time. When Mitch's family shows up unexpectedly, April pretends to be Mitch's girlfriend again...and it doesn't feel so fake anymore. Despite their obvious connection, April insists they’ve just been putting on an act. But when there’s the chance for something real, she has to decide whether to change her plans - and open her heart - for the kilt-wearing hunk who might just be the love of her life.&nbsp;</p>";
