window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Newly appointed priestess to the Temple of Aelynn Tasia Olympus is burdened with the greatest task to face any leader - saving her acolytes from a tsunami and finding them a new home. Her ability to communicate with the goddess cannot tell her how to protect three dozen virgins and an equal number of soldiers and sailors as they flee their doomed island. Experienced captain Nautilus the Navigator can tackle storms and sea, but obeying a young Seer who tells him to sail impossible shoals requires a level of belief that he doesn't possess. Giving up his future for a priestess who must remain untouched was not the payment he'd expected for his years of service. Together they must build a new home and sanctuary out of a volcanic island that promises plenty to those willing to sacrifice all they know for a future they can't predict. </p>";
