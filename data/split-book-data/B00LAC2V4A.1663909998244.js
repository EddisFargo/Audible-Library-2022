Alone and terrified, she doesn't know what to make of the very big, very angry man appearing at her door with two adorable hooligans in tow. </p><p>Does she take in this ill-tempered stranger and his children in exchange for learning what she needs to know? Or is she in danger that this recklessly ambitious man might teach her more about life than which fields to plant?</p>";
